# Modern Snake Game

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in C++ using the Raylib library, with an additional twist - ghost snakes as enemies!
The game provides an immersive experience where players control a snake, eat food, and avoid colliding with both their own tail and the ghost snakes roaming around.
